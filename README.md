## Lessons Learned
I could spend all day describing the lessons that I learned while taking this **freeCodeCamp** JavaScript Data Structures and Algorithms course, but the most important ones involved in my newfound understanding of data structures and algorithms. I always felt uncertain when it came to data structures and algorithms. I was somewhat familiar with the concepts, but I lacked a clear and confident understanding. I was stuck in different places, but the most difficult area was in the module 4 certification project which is builing cash register project. I have to do data manipulations with 2D arrays which is first time for me to do and I was initially felt overwhelming. With some focused research, I managed to make it work smoothly. This course helped me not just learning the theory, but also applying it through hands-on coding challenges. It gave me the clarity I needed and boosted my confidence in solving problems efficiently.
